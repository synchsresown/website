Crew's Log:

Red sky at morning. Ice thaws.
Undulant croons. Beach breaks waves.
Craft careened or crashed? Many rush to rescue.
Inspect a wounded 'Who's Who' of soggy parts. Take your pick.

Hell, Heal, Hull, Heel, Haul
Reverse Telescope: Body Of Water becomes Above Ground Pool.
Zoom out, Zoom in.

"Everyone is gathered in my backyard."

Pond in tow, all return to prod hidden defects.
Land locked. Inflated meanings deflate. All yours again.

Tools & Parts, shipyard scrapyard.
Stockpiling samples.
Conking bytes. Archipelago of Smiths.

Lagan.

"Only herds rust abroad!"

Separate the contents, spread it all out. Anew, each builds their own.

The Open Ocean.
