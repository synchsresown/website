Baby genius, double-helix, twin guards. Paranormal mechanism. A stupid child in the woods. A stunt double is a parody of the actor.  
  
"The process. And by means of the process..."  
  
An origamic architecture. A skybox and its cycle. Splayed outward into a map, then refolded and enclosed around the camera. Plot holes and palindromes. Kneading, folding, plotting, cooking. Tension between ingredients and recipe.  
  
"Talk went ambiguous. Abstractions passed as facts. A euphemistic language asserted itself."  
  
Orchid bloom / perfect beauty. Clipping tools, steamy greenhouse, heavy water, hidden reefs. Stages and sets. Short-term improvisation. An Organization - branches growing independently and almost touching (crown shyness).  
  
"I didn't solve anything, it just fell in on top of me."
