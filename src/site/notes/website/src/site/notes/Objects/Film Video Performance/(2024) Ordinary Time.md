[Ordinary Time (2024)](https://www.julibrandano.com/ordinary-time)
Premiere: June 6 and 7 at Pageant, NY

Ordinary Time occurs outside the major liturgical seasons, between holidays and major events. It's a time of maturation, labor, and embodying the rhythms of daily life. In Ordinary Time, the dancers do maintenance; work on their shapes. They go to practice, run routes, watch game tape, run it again. It's postseason, preseason. It's time to relive past lives, define present spaces, turn the dial, listen, wait.

Performed by Julia Antinozzi, Tim Bendernagel, Juli Brandano, Leah Fournier, Paulina Meneses, and Anna Thérèse Witenberg. Choreography by Juli Brandano in collaboration with the performers. Sound design by Kevin Carey Including Excerpts of “Blind” - Korn; “Mila’s Song in the Rain” - Éliane Radigue; Rill; NFL Theme in Bells Kevin Carey; Text read by Anna is sourced from Youtube Video titled “CJ STROUD Breaks Down His OWN Game Film”
