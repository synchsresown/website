🎰 🎰 🎰 

*A Mute Bard and Sir Curly*
*in the pit acting surly*
*when that Martin blew in like a Gale.*

*These three dolts in my head*
*how I wished them all dead*
*but then how would I tell you this tale?*

*A soothsayer returned*
*from his drunk seashore churn*
*with a drumbeat, a hiccup, and crick.*

*Between layers of turns*
*each unevenly learned*
*the proceeding precognitive tricks.*

*Then the gambler spoke*
*of an inside joke*
*and events manufactured as grim:*

*"Doesn't matter the smoke*
*once it clears you'll be broke*
*for The House, oh The House, always wins."*
