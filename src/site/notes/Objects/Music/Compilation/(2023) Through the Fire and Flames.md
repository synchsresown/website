The High Council of axemongers abides. They bear screaming blades of fret-forged light, string-lashed instruments wielded to sear new paths skyward. They stand astride 13 gleaming new pillars of soon-to-be-mythological guitar heroism, shining beacons of musical truth illuminating a world of grey.  
  
'Through the Fire and Flames' is a compilation of guitar music, defined in the most open sense. Enclosed are heart melters, head soothers, heavy hitters and more. It's a shrine to a sacred instrument, a pantheon of tributes from the furthest reaches of the shred spectrum. Guitar speaks to us. Guitar animates our beings. Guitar is language, communion, path — guitar is a way Through the Fire and Flames.
