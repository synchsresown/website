"Escape to a deserted island and create your own paradise as you explore, create, and customize."
Created during the early months of 2020's worldwide quarantine by 24 artists of the Quantum Natives network, based across Europe, the Americas and Asia.

"Your island getaway has a wealth of natural resources that can be used to craft everything from tools to creature comforts."

All songs are covers from the soundtrack to the "Animal Crossing" series, a popular life sim that has offered genuine solace during this time of confinement and isolation.

"Island living is even better when you can share it." 

As Quantum Natives' first paid release,100% of proceeds will go to help refugee crisis charities, such as Refugee Community Kitchen. The hope is that the combination of our enforced shelter, and the play of providing shelter, can manifest real help to those with such a deficit of security, rights, belongings or belonging.

"Even without hopping on a flight, you’ll meet a cast of charming animal residents bursting with personality."

The dreamy, ethereal textures of Monofee, Crown Shyness, enchanted lands and x/o, the melodic maquettes of Currance Evans, Yem Gel, Lawrence Lek and J. Ka Ching, the winding paths of Dasychira, Yikii and Taggerung, and the conceptual abstraction of i.ruuuuuu and Blue Stork, wrapped in the cover art of Jira Trello, of videogame art collective AAA Software. 

"Escape to your island getaway—however, whenever, and wherever you want."
